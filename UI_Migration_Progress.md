# UI Migration & Homepage Reconstruction Progress

This document tracks the progress of migrating UI elements, styling, and content from the provided Vite project to the Next.js frontend for BahtsulMasail.tech. The primary goal is to achieve a consistent look and feel with the Vite project while leveraging Next.js features.

## I. Initial Setup & Theming

1.  **Tailwind CSS Configuration (`frontend/tailwind.config.ts`):**
    *   Enabled Dark Mode: `darkMode: "class"`.
    *   Added a comprehensive color palette using CSS HSL variables (e.g., `primary: 'hsl(var(--primary))'`).
    *   Defined thematic colors (e.g., `islamic-blue: 'hsl(var(--islamic-blue-hsl))'`).
    *   Integrated custom font families (`Inter`, `Playfair Display`, `Amiri`) referencing CSS variables.
    *   Set `borderRadius` using `var(--radius)`.
    *   Standardized `transitionDuration`.

2.  **Global Styles (`frontend/src/app/globals.css`):**
    *   Imported Google Fonts (`Inter`, `Playfair Display`, `Amiri`).
    *   Defined all necessary CSS HSL variables from the Vite project's `index.css` within `@layer base` for both `:root` (light theme) and `.dark` (dark theme). This includes primary, secondary, accent, background, foreground, card, popover, destructive, muted, border, input, and ring colors, as well as additional thematic colors like `islamic-blue-hsl`, `islamic-green-hsl`, etc.
    *   Updated `body` styles to use `var(--font-sans)`.
    *   Migrated global styles (`html`, `*`) and custom utility classes from Vite (e.g., `.glass-morphism`, `.pattern-bg`, `.text-gradient-*`, `.card-islamic-*`, `.btn-islamic-*`, `.heading-islamic-*`, `.icon-container-*`, `.bg-blur-circle-*`, `.bg-islamic-pattern`, `.bg-congress-nu`).
    *   Refined global transitions into a `.smooth-transitions` utility class.

3.  **Font Conflict Resolution:**
    *   Identified and resolved an issue where default Next.js (Geist) fonts in `frontend/src/app/layout.tsx` were overriding the theme. Commented out Geist font usage to allow Tailwind and `globals.css` fonts to apply.

4.  **Theme Toggling Functionality:**
    *   Installed `next-themes` package.
    *   Wrapped the root layout in `frontend/src/app/layout.tsx` with `ThemeProvider` from `next-themes`.
    *   Created a `ThemeToggleButton.tsx` component in `frontend/src/components/common/`.
    *   Integrated the `ThemeToggleButton` into the `Navbar.tsx` component.
    *   Addressed and resolved a "Hydration failed" error related to SSR by refining `ThemeToggleButton.tsx`.

## II. Shadcn/ui Integration

1.  **Initialization & Component Addition:**
    *   Ran `npx shadcn@latest init` to set up `components.json`, update `tailwind.config.ts` and `globals.css`, and create `src/lib/utils.ts`.
    *   Added required UI components (`button`, `card`, `input`, `dialog`, `label`, `select`, `table`, `avatar`) to `frontend/src/components/ui/` using `npx shadcn@latest add`.

2.  **Theme Reintegration Post-Shadcn:**
    *   **`globals.css`:**
        *   Restored all custom Islamic theme HSL variables for core colors (background, foreground, primary, etc.) in `:root` and `.dark`, as Shadcn's init had overwritten them.
        *   Restored custom `--radius` and `--transition-duration`.
        *   Re-added additional thematic HSL variables (e.g., `--islamic-blue-hsl`, `--islamic-purple-hsl`).
        *   Ensured all custom utility classes remained intact and correctly used HSL variables.
    *   **`tailwind.config.ts`:**
        *   Corrected `darkMode` back to `"class"`.
        *   Ensured `content` paths were comprehensive.
        *   Updated named theme colors (e.g., `islamic-blue`) to correctly reference their CSS HSL variables (e.g., `islamic-blue: "hsl(var(--islamic-blue-hsl))"`).
        *   Removed default `chart-*` colors introduced by Shadcn if not needed.
        *   Verified custom font families and other theme settings.

## III. Homepage Reconstruction (`frontend/src/app/page.tsx`)

The primary goal was to replicate the structure and content of the Vite project's `Index.tsx` page.

1.  **Core Structure & Animations:**
    *   Installed `framer-motion` for animations.
    *   Created `frontend/src/lib/animations.ts` and populated it with animation variants (`easeCurve`, `fadeUp`, `fadeScale`, `stagger`, `itemVariant`, `containerVariant`) from the Vite project.
    *   Developed `frontend/src/components/layout/MainLayout.tsx`:
        *   Includes the existing `Navbar` and a new `Footer` placeholder.
        *   Incorporates background decorative elements (`bg-blur-circle-*`, `pattern-bg`) with `z-0`.
        *   Wraps page content (`children`) in a `<motion.main>` tag with `containerVariant` animations, Navbar offset padding (`pt-16 sm:pt-20`), and `z-10`.
    *   Updated `frontend/src/app/layout.tsx` to use `MainLayout`.
    *   Set `frontend/src/app/page.tsx` as a client component (`'use client'`).
    *   Used `framer-motion` (`motion.div`, `useInView`, `containerVariant`, `fadeUp`) for animating section appearances.

2.  **Implemented Homepage Sections (in `frontend/src/components/home/`):**

    *   **`HeroSection.tsx`:**
        *   Installed `lucide-react` for icons.
        *   Adapted JSX, styling, and animations from Vite.
        *   Utilizes Shadcn `Button` and `Input`.
        *   Includes decorative blur circles, `pattern-bg`, and a complex radial gradient background using HSL CSS variables.
    *   **`FeaturesSection.tsx`:**
        *   Adapted from Vite, uses Shadcn `Card` and `CardContent`.
        *   Features a data array for dynamic card styling based on a `themeColor` prop.
        *   Includes `lucide-react` icons.
    *   **`CategoriesSection.tsx`:**
        *   Uses mock data. Defines a `Category` type and `CategoryCard` sub-component with dynamic styling.
        *   Added "islamic-earth" color to `globals.css` and `tailwind.config.ts`.
    *   **`ScholarlyQuoteSection.tsx`:**
        *   Adapted complex carousel logic, quote data, styling, and animations from Vite.
        *   Uses `lucide-react` icons.
        *   Added "islamic-dark" color to `globals.css` and `tailwind.config.ts`.
        *   Features animated `clip-path` backgrounds and `pattern-bg`.
        *   Quote card uses `glass-morphism`. Handles Arabic text (`font-arabic`, `dir="rtl"`).
    *   **`RecentDocumentsSection.tsx`:**
        *   Installed `date-fns` for date formatting.
        *   Added "islamic-maroon" color to `globals.css` and `tailwind.config.ts`.
        *   Includes mock data, helper functions (category/color mapping, excerpt), and a `DocumentCard` sub-component.
        *   Corrected import paths for UI components (e.g. `@/components/ui/button`).
        *   Resolved TypeScript type error for `mockDocuments.status` by explicitly typing the array.
    *   **`TestimonialsSection.tsx`:**
        *   Created with mock data, carousel logic, and animations.
        *   Uses Shadcn `Avatar`, `Card`.
        *   Ensured `Avatar` component was installed via `npx shadcn@latest add avatar`.
    *   **`CallToActionSection.tsx`:**
        *   Created with a prominent heading, descriptive text, and call-to-action buttons.
        *   Integrated into `page.tsx`, replacing its placeholder.

## IV. General Error Resolution & Refinements

*   Consistently addressed linter errors related to import paths (ensuring usage of `@/` alias for components and lib).
*   Fixed TypeScript type errors as they arose, for example, by explicitly typing mock data arrays.
*   Iteratively refined component structure and styling to match the Vite project's design.

This summarizes the major steps taken to align the Next.js frontend with the Vite project's UI/UX.
