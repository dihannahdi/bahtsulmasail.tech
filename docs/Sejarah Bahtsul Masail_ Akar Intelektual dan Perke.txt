Nahdlatul Ulama and the Bahtsul Masail Tradition: Pillars of Indonesian IslamI. Introduction: Pillars of Indonesian Islam – Nahdlatul Ulama and the Bahtsul Masail TraditionA. Overview of Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) and Bahtsul Masail (BM)Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), literally the "Revival of the Ulama (Islamic Scholars)," stands as the largest independent Islamic organization not only in Indonesia but globally, claiming a membership exceeding 40 million in 2023.1 Founded in 1926, NU has evolved beyond a purely religious entity into a formidable socio-cultural and, at various junctures in Indonesian history, political force. Its influence permeates Indonesian society through a vast network of educational institutions, social services, and community initiatives.Central to NU's intellectual and religious dynamism is the tradition of Bahtsul Masail (BM), a distinctive forum for collective religious deliberation and the formulation of legal rulings (fatwas). This practice is deeply entrenched in classical Islamic scholarship and serves as NU's primary mechanism for addressing contemporary issues through the lens of traditional Islamic jurisprudence.1 This report aims to provide a comprehensive historical analysis of Nahdlatul Ulama and the Bahtsul Masail tradition, examining their intertwined development, foundational principles, methodologies, and profound impact on the landscape of Indonesian Islam and the broader societal fabric.B. The Symbiotic Relationship and Enduring SignificanceThe relationship between Nahdlatul Ulama and Bahtsul Masail is profoundly symbiotic. NU provides the extensive institutional framework, the mass membership base, and the societal authority that lend considerable weight and reach to the rulings and deliberations emanating from Bahtsul Masail. Conversely, the rigorous scholarly process and intellectual outputs of Bahtsul Masail furnish NU with the jurisprudential legitimacy and intellectual credibility underpinning its religious pronouncements and social stances. This synergy is fundamental to NU's enduring dynamism and its continued relevance in a rapidly changing world.Collectively, NU and Bahtsul Masail have been instrumental in shaping and promoting a form of Islam in Indonesia that is often characterized by its moderation, cultural adaptability, and inclusiveness – qualities frequently associated with the concept of Islam Nusantara (Archipelagic Islam). The enduring legacy of NU and Bahtsul Masail can be understood through their successful synthesis of textual fidelity to classical Islamic sources and a remarkable contextual adaptability to the diverse and evolving socio-historical realities of Indonesia. This synthesis has not only allowed traditional Islam to thrive but also to remain a relevant and constructive force in a modernizing nation-state. The very existence and operationalization of Bahtsul Masail within such a massive organization challenge monolithic perceptions of Islamic law as inherently rigid or solely imposed from the top down. Instead, it showcases a deliberative, community-rooted (among scholars), and intellectually vibrant approach to jurisprudence, where collective reasoning and textual interpretation are paramount.II. The Genesis and Ascent of Nahdlatul UlamaA. The Indonesian Socio-Religious Milieu and the Imperative for NU's EstablishmentThe early 20th century in the Indonesian archipelago, then the Dutch East Indies, was a period of significant social, political, and religious ferment.5 The colonial administration exerted considerable influence, while within the Muslim community, new currents of thought were emerging. This era witnessed the rise of Islamic modernist movements such as Muhammadiyah (founded 1912), Persatuan Islam (PERSIS), and Al-Irshad Al-Islamiya.1 These organizations, often inspired by reformist ideas from the Middle East, advocated for a "purification" of Islam, urging a direct return to the Qur'an and Hadith. They frequently criticized established traditionalist practices, such as qunut (a special supplication in dawn prayer), tawassul (seeking intercession), and tarekat (Sufi orders), labeling them as bid'ah (reprehensible religious innovations) and often rejecting the binding authority of the classical madhahib (schools of Islamic jurisprudence).1A critical external factor galvanizing traditionalist ulama was the political and religious shift in the Hijaz (now Saudi Arabia). The ascendancy of Ibn Saud and the imposition of Wahhabist ideology threatened the diversity of madhahib and traditional Islamic practices in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina.1 This development created a sense of urgency among Indonesian ulama who adhered to these traditions and schools of law. The modernist challenge and the events in Hijaz were perceived as direct threats to the pesantren (traditional Islamic boarding school) culture, an ecosystem where "traditional Islam" had been deeply rooted and preserved for centuries.5 These pesantren were not merely educational institutions but also vital centers of community life and scholarly transmission.In response to the situation in Hijaz, traditionalist ulama, spearheaded by K.H. Abdul Wahab Hasbullah with the counsel of K.H. Hasyim Asy'ari, formed the Komite Hijaz (Hijaz Committee). The committee's objective was to dispatch a delegation to King Ibn Saud to advocate for the continued respect for the four Sunni madhahib and the protection of traditional Islamic practices and historical sites in the holy lands.1 This committee is widely regarded as the immediate precursor to the formal establishment of Nahdlatul Ulama. Prior to this, K.H. Abdul Wahab Hasbullah had already initiated several organizations, including Nahdlatul Wathan (Revival of the Homeland) around 1914-1916, which aimed to foster nationalistic sentiments alongside religious education; Tashwirul Afkar (Illumination of Thoughts), also known as Nahdlatul Fikri (Revival of Thought), around 1917-1918, a discussion forum for religious and socio-political issues; and Nahdlatul Tujjar (Revival of Tradesmen), which focused on the economic empowerment of the community.1 These earlier endeavors laid some of the foundational groundwork for a more comprehensive organization to represent traditionalist interests.The establishment of Nahdlatul Ulama was, therefore, a multifaceted defensive strategy. It was theological, aimed at countering the puritanical interpretations of Wahhabism and some modernist groups. It was methodological, by explicitly upholding the authority of the madhahib and the practice of taqlid (following qualified scholarly opinion). It was cultural, seeking to preserve local Islamic practices that had been integrated into community life. Finally, it was institutional, designed to protect the pesantren system as the bedrock of traditional Islamic learning and values. This confluence of factors underscores that NU's founding was not a singular reaction but a comprehensive effort to safeguard an entire established Islamic ecosystem. Furthermore, the formation of NU can be interpreted as an early articulation of a form of "religious nationalism." The defense of specific Indonesian Islamic traditions became intertwined with a burgeoning sense of distinct Indonesian identity and a desire for autonomy from both Dutch colonial power and what was perceived as foreign religious hegemonies, such as the strict interpretation of Wahhabism. The very name of K.H. Abdul Wahab Hasbullah's earlier organization, Nahdlatul Wathan ("Revival of the Homeland"), with its explicitly "nationalistic and moderate character" 1, and NU's early actions like banning support for the Dutch military 5, point towards this intertwining of religious and national consciousness.B. Key Founders and the Articulation of Foundational PrinciplesNahdlatul Ulama was formally established on 31 January 1926, corresponding to 16 Rajab 1344 H, in the city of Surabaya, East Java.1 The organization emerged from the collective will of prominent kyais (Islamic scholars). Central to its founding were K.H. Hasyim Asy'ari, who was designated as the first Rais Akbar (Supreme Leader), and K.H. Abdul Wahab Hasbullah, a dynamic organizer and visionary.1 Other notable ulama present at the founding meeting included K.H. Bisri Syansuri and K.H. Raden Asnawi.6The core religious ideology adopted by NU was Ahl al-Sunnah wa al-Jama'ah (Aswaja), meaning "the People of the Sunnah (Prophetic Tradition) and the Community".1 This declaration became the defining characteristic of NU, clearly distinguishing it from modernist groups and aligning it with the mainstream orthodox understanding of Sunni Islam. The theological underpinnings of NU's Aswaja were meticulously articulated:
In Kalam (Islamic theology), NU adheres to the schools of Imam Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari and Imam Abu Mansur al-Maturidi. This choice signifies a commitment to a "middle path" that balances rationalist and scripturalist tendencies in theological reasoning.1
In Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), NU recognizes the legitimacy of all four major Sunni schools of law: Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, and Hanbali. However, in practice, its followers predominantly adhere to the Shafi'i school, which is prevalent in Southeast Asia.1 A foundational goal was "to hold firmly one of the four madhahib".6
In Tasawwuf (Islamic mysticism or Sufism), NU follows the moderate and widely accepted paths of Imam al-Ghazali and Imam Junayd al-Baghdadi, emphasizing spiritual purification and ethical development within the bounds of Shari'ah.1
To provide a formal basis for the organization, K.H. Hasyim Asy'ari formulated key foundational texts, notably the Kitab Qanun Asasi (Book of Basic Principles/Statutes) and the Kitab I'tiqad Ahlussunnah Wal Jamaah (Book on the Creed of Ahlussunnah Wal Jamaah). These documents were later embodied in the Khittah NU (literally "NU's Line"), which serves as the organization's guiding principles for thought and action in religious, social, and political spheres.1The initial objectives of NU were multifaceted: to defend and promote traditionalist Islamic practices based on Ahl al-Sunnah wa al-Jama'ah, to uphold the doctrines of this school of thought, and significantly, to protect and advance the economic interests of its members, who were largely drawn from rural communities and merchant classes connected to the pesantren network.2 Furthermore, NU aimed to foster relationships and solidarity among ulama who followed the four recognized madhahib and to propagate Islam according to these established schools using appropriate and effective methods.6While the term Islam Nusantara (Archipelagic Islam) gained prominence later, its conceptual roots can be traced back to NU's foundational acceptance of local Indonesian cultural traditions, provided they do not conflict with fundamental Islamic law.1 Islam Nusantara champions moderation, anti-fundamentalism, pluralism, and a degree of syncretism that reflects Islam's historical interaction, contextualization, and indigenization within the diverse socio-cultural conditions of the Indonesian archipelago.The specific codification of Ahl al-Sunnah wa al-Jama'ah through Ash'ari/Maturidi theology, Shafi'i jurisprudence, and Ghazalian Sufism was a deliberate and strategic undertaking. It provided a clear, defensible, and historically rooted identity for traditionalist Islam in Indonesia. This comprehensive framework offered a robust intellectual counter-narrative to the critiques leveled by modernist movements, anchoring NU's tradition in widely respected and authoritative Sunni scholarship, thus making it more resilient against dismissal. The Qanun Asasi then formalized this framework, giving it constitutional status within the organization. Moreover, NU's initial dual focus on defending traditional religious practices and safeguarding its members' economic interests 2 reveals an early, pragmatic understanding that religious identity and socio-economic well-being were inextricably linked for its constituency. The inclusion of merchants among its founders and the existence of precursor organizations like Nahdlatul Tujjar 1 underscore this. This holistic approach, addressing both spiritual and material concerns, likely contributed significantly to NU's broad appeal and rapid growth.C. Navigating Historical Tides: NU through Colonialism, Occupation, and IndependenceNahdlatul Ulama's formative years and subsequent development were profoundly shaped by the tumultuous historical currents that swept across Indonesia, from the late colonial period through the Japanese occupation and the struggle for independence.

Dutch Colonial Period (1926-1942):Initially, NU adopted a non-political stance, functioning primarily as a socio-religious organization (jam'iyah diniyah Islamiyah).5 The Dutch colonial government legally acknowledged NU on February 6, 1930 (though one source says February 30, likely a typo for February 6), on the condition that its activities remained outside the political arena.6 Despite this official non-political status, NU could not remain aloof from the political realities of colonial oppression. It played a pivotal role in opposing Dutch policies perceived as detrimental to Indonesians and Muslims. Notably, NU issued directives banning Muslim youth from entering Dutch military service, prohibiting Muslims from supporting the Dutch army, and rejecting Dutch financial aid offered to NU-affiliated madrasas (Islamic schools).5 The organization also supported the Gabungan Politik Indonesia (GAPPI) in its demand for the establishment of the Majelis Rakyat Indonesia (Council of the Indonesian People) and urged the Dutch authorities to revoke the discriminatory Guru Ordonantie (Teacher Ordinance), which adversely affected madrasas and pesantrens.6 In a significant move towards broader Islamic coordination, NU, along with Muhammadiyah and other Islamic organizations, co-founded the Majelis Islam A'la Indonesia (MIAI – Supreme Islamic Council of Indonesia) in 1937. K.H. Wahid Hasyim, son of K.H. Hasyim Asy'ari and a prominent NU figure, became a leader within MIAI.2


Japanese Occupation (1942-1945):The Japanese invasion and occupation brought new challenges and, paradoxically, new opportunities. Initially, the Japanese military administration disbanded all existing social and political organizations, including NU. Consequently, NU's activities were largely restricted to administering madrasas and pesantrens and preserving Islamic preaching.6 Key NU leaders, including K.H. Hasyim Asy'ari and K.H. Mahfudz Shiddiq, were arrested by Japanese military authorities on suspicion of organizing anti-Japanese movements, though they were later released.6 A defining moment of resistance during this period was K.H. Hasyim Asy'ari's firm rejection of the Japanese order for Indonesians to perform saikeirei (bowing towards the rising sun and the Japanese emperor). He issued a fatwa declaring saikeirei to be shirk (polytheism, associating others with God) and thus forbidden by Islam, an act of defiance that likely contributed to his arrest.6Unlike the Dutch, the Japanese military government eventually allowed, and even encouraged, Muslim participation in governmental politics and military training. They established the Shumubu (Office of Religious Affairs), which K.H. Hasyim Asy'ari later headed, with his son K.H. Wahid Hasyim managing its day-to-day operations.6 In 1943, the Japanese sponsored the formation of Masyumi (Majelis Syuro Muslimin Indonesia – Consultative Council of Indonesian Muslims), with K.H. Hasyim Asy'ari as its president and K.H. Wahid Hasyim as vice-chairman.2 Furthermore, military units for Muslim youths, Hizbullah (Army of God), and for ulama, Sabilillah (God's Path), were founded in late 1944. NU leaders like K.H. Zainul Arifin (for Hizbullah) and K.H. Masykur (for Sabilillah) played prominent roles in these organizations, which provided modern weapons training to their members.2


Indonesian National Revolution / Independence War (1945-1949):Following Japan's surrender in August 1945 and Indonesia's proclamation of independence, NU wholeheartedly supported the new republic.2 The return of the Dutch, seeking to re-establish colonial rule, ignited a fierce war for independence. In this critical juncture, NU played a defining role. On October 22, 1945, in Surabaya, NU issued the historic Resolusi Jihad (Jihad Resolution). This resolution declared that defending Indonesian independence against the Dutch colonial forces and their allies was a holy war (jihad) and a fard 'ain (an individual religious obligation) for every Muslim living within a 94-kilometer radius of the conflict, with those outside this radius obliged to provide assistance.2 This day is now commemorated annually as National Santri Day in Indonesia.The Resolusi Jihad had a profound impact, galvanizing Indonesian Muslims to join the struggle. NU-led guerrilla groups, such as Hizbullah and Sabilillah, along with many kyais and santris (pesantren students), actively participated in the armed resistance against the Dutch.2 K.H. Hasyim Asy'ari continued to issue fatwas encouraging jihad and even used his pesantren in Tebuireng as a headquarters for fighters.6 During this period, K.H. Wahid Hasyim also played an important role in the complex negotiations and reformulations of Pancasila as the philosophical basis of the Indonesian state, ensuring its acceptance by various groups.6

NU's engagement throughout these tumultuous periods—colonial rule, Japanese occupation, and the independence war—demonstrates a sophisticated practical application of "political fiqh." Decisions, such as the initial non-cooperation with the Dutch, the tactical engagement with certain Japanese-sponsored bodies, and the eventual declaration of an all-out jihad for independence, appear to have been guided by careful assessments of maslahah (public interest or welfare) and mafsadah (harm) for the Muslim community and the nascent Indonesian nation. The shift from a non-political stance under Dutch rule 6 to active resistance 5 illustrates a pragmatic response to increasing oppression. Similarly, the cooperation with the Japanese in organizations like Shumubu and Masyumi 6, despite initial arrests of NU leaders, can be interpreted as a strategic maneuver to gain influence, administrative experience, and prepare for future eventualities, such as the military training acquired through Hizbullah and Sabilillah. The Resolusi Jihad 2 itself was a clear application of Islamic legal concepts to a specific political-military crisis, framing national defense as a paramount religious duty. This pattern suggests that NU's decisions were not arbitrary but were calculated actions based on perceived benefits and harms within an overarching Islamic framework.Paradoxically, the Japanese occupation, despite its hardships, provided NU with unforeseen opportunities. The dismantling of Dutch colonial structures and the Japanese search for local allies led to the appointment of NU leaders to key positions in Japanese-sponsored organizations.6 This afforded them valuable administrative experience and enhanced their public visibility. Crucially, the formation of Hizbullah and Sabilillah provided NU-affiliated youth and ulama with modern weapons training and organizational skills.6 These resources, experiences, and the consolidated leadership proved indispensable during the subsequent arduous struggle for Indonesian independence against the returning Dutch forces.D. NU in Post-Independence Indonesia: Political Engagements and Societal ContributionsThe achievement of Indonesian independence marked a new chapter for Nahdlatul Ulama, ushering in a period of direct political engagement, followed by strategic shifts in its relationship with state power, all while continuing its core socio-religious mission.

Early Post-Independence (1950s):Following the recognition of Indonesian independence, NU initially became a component of the newly established Masyumi party, a broad coalition of Islamic organizations. However, dissatisfaction with its perceived limited influence within Masyumi, particularly after the party's religious council was rendered powerless, led NU to withdraw on April 5, 1952.2 Subsequently, on August 30, 1952, NU transformed itself into an independent political party.2 In the 1955 parliamentary elections, the NU party achieved remarkable success, securing the third-largest share of the vote (18.4%) and gaining 45 seats in the People's Representative Council. Its support was particularly strong in rural Java, reflecting its deep grassroots connections through the pesantren network.2 During this period, NU, as a political party, initially advocated for Indonesia to become an Islamic state and expressed opposition to President Sukarno's "guided democracy" concept, partly due to fears of Communist Party (PKI) influence in the cabinet.2


Guided Democracy and New Order Era (1957-1998):In the Constitutional Assembly (Konstituante), tasked with drafting a permanent constitution, NU joined the "Islamic Block" which continued to push for an Islamic state. However, the assembly failed to reach a consensus, and was eventually dissolved by President Sukarno in 1959, who reinstated the 1945 Constitution based on Pancasila.2 The political landscape shifted dramatically in the mid-1960s. Following the alleged coup attempt by the 30 September Movement in 1965, NU sided with General Suharto's army in the ensuing anti-communist purges. NU members and its youth wing, Ansor, were involved in the mass killings of alleged PKI members and sympathizers.2 This dark chapter remains a complex and controversial aspect of NU's history, often explained by NU figures as a necessary defense of Islam and the nation against a perceived existential communist threat.Under Suharto's authoritarian New Order regime (1966-1998), political freedoms were curtailed. In 1973, as part of a forced simplification of the political party system, NU, along with other Islamic parties, was compelled to merge into the United Development Party (Partai Persatuan Pembangunan, PPP).2 Dissatisfaction grew within NU regarding its lack of influence within the PPP. A pivotal moment came in 1984, during NU's National Congress (Muktamar) in Situbondo. Under the leadership of Abdurrahman Wahid (popularly known as Gus Dur), K.H. Hasyim Asy'ari's grandson, NU made the historic decision to formally withdraw from practical party politics and return to its original Khittah (spirit/path) of 1926 as a socio-religious organization.2 Concurrently, NU officially accepted Pancasila as the sole basis of the state (asas tunggal), a move Gus Dur described as a "noble compromise" enabling NU to refocus on its core mission of religious guidance, education, and social welfare.2


Post-New Order / Reformation Era (1998-Present):The fall of Suharto in 1998 ushered in an era of democratic transition known as Reformasi. In July 1998, Gus Dur announced the formation of the National Awakening Party (Partai Kebangkitan Bangsa, PKB), a political party with strong ties to NU's constituency.2 In the 1999 general elections, PKB secured 13% of the vote, and in a surprising turn of events, Abdurrahman Wahid was elected President of Indonesia by the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR).2 His presidency, however, was short-lived, ending in 2001.Reflecting on its past political experiences, NU decided at its 2010 Muktamar in Makassar to further distance the organization itself from direct political entanglement by banning its officials from holding concurrent leadership positions in political parties.2 This aimed to preserve NU's neutrality and focus on its broader societal role.In contemporary Indonesia, NU's primary focus remains the propagation of Islam Nusantara as a model of tolerant, moderate, and culturally sensitive Islam. It actively engages in countering religious extremism, radicalism, and terrorism through theological discourse, community programs, and educational initiatives.2 The organization continues to make significant contributions to Indonesian society through its extensive network of social services, including operating thousands of pesantren (6,830 according to one source) and a growing number of universities (44 by 2023), as well as programs aimed at economic development and poverty alleviation.2 NU has also launched global initiatives to promote its vision of moderate Islam and counter extremism, including the establishment of Bayt ar-Rahmah (House of Mercy) in the United States.2

NU's political trajectory throughout post-independence Indonesia reflects a continuous and often complex negotiation between its identity as a mass-based socio-religious organization and the allure, and at times perceived necessity, of direct political power. The "return to the Khittah" in 1984 was a crucial strategic recalibration, representing a formal retreat from partisan politics to safeguard its core mission and unity, although its political influence undeniably continued through informal channels and later through affiliated parties like PKB. This decision was a recognition that direct involvement in party politics could potentially compromise its broader socio-religious role and internal cohesion. The subsequent emergence of PKB demonstrated that while the organization itself stepped back from formal party structures, its vast constituency and many of its influential leaders remained politically active, indicating a more nuanced and indirect approach to political engagement.Furthermore, NU's acceptance of Pancasila and its vigorous championing of Islam Nusantara are not merely ideological stances but also strategically astute responses to Indonesia's deeply pluralistic reality and the global rise of exclusivist and extremist interpretations of Islam. The acceptance of Pancasila as the state ideology 2 was vital for NU's survival and legitimacy under the New Order regime, but it also resonated with NU's traditional emphasis on national unity, a principle evident even in the Resolusi Jihad. The concept of Islam Nusantara 1 provides a robust theological framework for an Indonesian expression of Islam that is both authentically rooted in Ahl al-Sunnah wa al-Jama'ah and harmoniously integrated with local cultures. This offers a compelling indigenous alternative to transnational Islamist ideologies that often disregard local contexts and promote rigid, monolithic interpretations of the faith. NU's active counter-extremism efforts 8 are a direct and practical application of these principles, positioning the organization as a key ideological pillar supporting the Indonesian state's pluralistic foundations against both internal and external challenges.Table 1: Key Historical Periods and NU's Corresponding Role/TransformationPeriodNU's Key Activities/StanceMajor ChallengesSignificant Outcomes/TransformationsPre-Independence: Dutch Colonial (1926-1942)Socio-religious focus (jam'iyah diniyah); Non-cooperation with Dutch military/aid; Co-founded MIAI.Colonial repression; Rise of modernist critique; Economic hardship.Consolidation of traditionalist Islam as an organized force; Articulation of Aswaja identity; Early anti-colonial resistance.Pre-Independence: Japanese Occupation (1942-1945)Initial disbandment, then tactical cooperation; Leaders in Shumubu & Masyumi; Formation of Hizbullah & Sabilillah military units; Fatwa against saikeirei.Japanese military control; Arrest of leaders; Pressure for ideological conformity.Gained administrative and political experience; Developed military capacity among youth and ulama; Strengthened nationalist resolve.Independence War (1945-1949)Resolusi Jihad (Oct 1945); Active participation in armed struggle; Fatwas supporting independence fight; Role in Pancasila formulation.Dutch military aggression aiming for re-colonization; Internal political divisions.Pivotal role in mobilizing mass resistance and securing independence; NU established as a key nationalist and religious force.Liberal Democracy Era (1950-1957)Left Masyumi (1952); Became an independent political party; Strong showing in 1955 elections; Advocated for an Islamic state.Political competition; Ideological debates on state foundation; Regional rebellions.Emergence as a major political force with a strong grassroots base; Articulation of distinct political interests.Guided Democracy & New Order Era (1957-1998)Failed push for Islamic state in Konstituante; Involvement in 1965-66 anti-PKI purges; Forced merger into PPP (1973); Return to Khittah 1926 (1984); Acceptance of Pancasila.Authoritarian rule; Suppression of political dissent; Internal debates on political role.Shift from direct partisan politics to socio-religious focus; Ideological strengthening around Pancasila; Navigating survival and influence under authoritarianism.Post-New Order/Reformation Era (1998-Present)Formation of PKB (1998); Gus Dur's presidency (1999-2001); Formal disengagement from party politics (2010); Promotion of Islam Nusantara; Counter-extremism efforts.Rise of religious radicalism; Political fragmentation; Maintaining unity and relevance.Re-emergence as a key socio-political influencer; Global advocacy for moderate Islam; Continued focus on education and social welfare.2III. Bahtsul Masail: The Intellectual and Juridical Engine of Traditional Islam in IndonesiaA. Ancient Roots: The Pesantren Scholarly Tradition and Precursors to Bahtsul MasailThe Bahtsul Masail tradition, while most prominently associated with Nahdlatul Ulama, has its origins deeply embedded within the scholarly culture of Indonesian pesantren.3 For centuries, these Islamic boarding schools have served as vital centers for the intensive study of classical Islamic texts, commonly referred to as kitab kuning (yellow books, due to the traditional paper color). Within this environment, a dynamic intellectual tradition of discussion and debate flourished.A key precursor to the Bahtsul Masail format was the practice of halaqah (study circles). This model, prevalent in centers of Islamic learning in the Holy Land, particularly Mecca, involved scholars and students gathering for interactive study, discussion, and debate on religious and societal issues. Indonesian scholars who pursued advanced studies in Mecca and other Middle Eastern centers brought this pedagogical approach back to the archipelago, implementing it within the pesantren system.15 The halaqah emphasized not just passive reception of knowledge but active engagement with texts and ideas.Within the pesantren context, Bahtsul Masail as practiced by NU is essentially an extension and formalization of long-standing scholarly activities often known as mushawarah (deliberation or consultation) or takrar (repetition and review, often leading to deeper discussion and clarification of texts).3 These sessions involved kyais and senior santris meticulously examining classical texts to find solutions to contemporary problems or to clarify complex legal and theological points.An important institutional forerunner that embodied this spirit of collective inquiry was Taswirul Afkar (Illumination of Thoughts). Established around 1917-1919 in Surabaya by K.H. Abdul Wahab Chasbullah, who himself had studied in Mecca, Taswirul Afkar initially served as a forum for discussing pressing socio-political issues of the day. Over time, its scope expanded to include religious topics, making it a significant embryonic form of the Bahtsul Masail tradition that would later be adopted and systematized by Nahdlatul Ulama.1The origins of the Bahtsul Masail tradition within the pesantren environment demonstrate an indigenous intellectual dynamism that predates the formal establishment of Nahdlatul Ulama. NU did not invent this practice out of whole cloth; rather, it recognized the profound value of this existing scholarly culture, institutionalized it, and scaled it to a national organizational level, thereby significantly amplifying its impact and reach. The explicit statements that Bahtsul Masail is an "imported" tradition from Mecca (the halaqah model) which was already thriving in pesantren before NU's formation 15, and the citation of Taswirul Afkar as an "embryo" 7, clearly point to a developmental process rather than a sudden creation. The methodological and textual continuity between pesantren mushawarah and NU's Bahtsul Masail further substantiates this. Thus, NU's crucial role was one of systematization, formalization, and amplification of a deeply rooted scholarly heritage.Furthermore, the historical reliance on kitab kuning and the halaqah model within pesantren signifies a profound commitment to a specific epistemology. This epistemology is rooted in textual authority derived from classical scholarship, rigorous scholarly debate as a means of interpretation, and the transmission of knowledge through established chains of learning (isnad). NU, by adopting and promoting Bahtsul Masail, sought to preserve and champion this traditionalist epistemology against modernist calls for direct, unmediated ijtihad (independent legal reasoning) by individuals, irrespective of their depth of scholarly training. This highlights a fundamental divergence in how religious knowledge, authority, and the process of legal interpretation were conceived by traditionalists versus their modernist counterparts in early 20th-century Indonesia.B. The Architecture of Deliberation: Methodology, Classical Texts (Kitab Kuning), and Evolving ApproachesBahtsul Masail, literally translating to "discussion" or "examination of problems" 4, functions as a highly structured scientific forum. It convenes NU kyais, ulama, and scholars with the primary purpose of providing legal certainty through the issuance of fatwas (religious legal opinions) in response to dynamic and often complex societal problems.3 The overarching aim is to bridge the gap between foundational religious texts and the lived realities of contemporary activities and challenges.18

Primary Sources (Maraji’):The ultimate sources of Islamic law are unequivocally the Qur'an and the Sunnah (Prophetic traditions).1 However, in the Bahtsul Masail process, direct interpretation of these primary sources is mediated through the rich heritage of classical Islamic jurisprudence. Therefore, the forum primarily relies on al-kutub al-mu'tabarah (authoritative classical books), often referred to in Indonesia as kitab kuning. These texts are predominantly from the four major Sunni madhahib (schools of law: Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, Hanbali), with a particularly strong emphasis on the Shafi'i school, reflecting its historical prevalence in Southeast Asia.1 Prominent examples of Shafi'i texts frequently consulted include I’anah al-Ṭālibīn, Fatḥ al-Mu’in, Fatḥ al-Wahhab bi Sharḥ Manhaj al-Ṭullāb, and al-Majmūʿ Sharḥ al-Muhadhdhab.4


Methodological Approaches (Istinbath al-Hukm – Derivation of Rulings):The derivation of legal rulings in Bahtsul Masail follows a hierarchical and evolving set of methodologies:

Qauly (Textual/Referential): This is the foundational and most frequently employed method. It involves directly referencing explicit statements (ibarat), opinions (qaul), or interpretations (wajh) found within the kitab kuning. If a clear and relevant textual answer from an authoritative classical jurist is available, it is generally adopted.4 In instances where multiple differing opinions exist within the classical texts of a particular madhhab (especially the Shafi'i school), a process of taqrir jama'i (collective selection or affirmation) is undertaken. This selection is often guided by established principles of preference within the madhhab, such as favoring the opinions of highly esteemed jurists like Imam al-Nawawi and Imam al-Rafi'i (often referred to as al-Syaikhani in Shafi'i jurisprudence), or opting for the opinion deemed more beneficial (maslahah) or stronger in its reasoning.4
Ilhaqy (Analogical): This method is employed when no direct textual answer (qaul or wajh) can be found in the classical sources for a specific contemporary issue. It involves ilhaq al-masail bi nazhairiha – analogizing the new case to existing cases that have established rulings in the classical texts, based on a shared underlying legal cause ('illah) or principle. This is a form of qiyas (analogical reasoning), a recognized source of law in classical Islamic jurisprudence.4
Manhajy (Methodological/Principle-Based): This approach is applied when neither the qauly nor ilhaqy methods are deemed sufficient to address a novel or particularly complex contemporary issue for which classical texts offer no direct precedent or clear analogy. The manhajy method involves applying the broader legal principles (qawa'id al-ushuliyyah – principles of jurisprudence, and qawa'id al-fiqhiyyah – general legal maxims) and the established methodologies of the imams of the recognized madhahib. This allows for a form of collective ijtihad (istinbath jama'i) that remains anchored within the framework and spirit of the classical schools of law, rather than being an entirely unrestricted form of reasoning.4 The formal recognition and encouragement of the manhajy approach, particularly since the NU National Conference (Munas) in Lampung in 1992, marked a significant development in Bahtsul Masail's capacity to engage with modernity.



Process of Deliberation:The Bahtsul Masail forum follows a structured deliberative process. Issues for discussion are typically proposed in advance, often accompanied by a detailed "description of the issue" (taswir al-mas'alah) outlining the problem and the specific legal questions arising from it.15 For complex contemporary issues requiring specialized knowledge (e.g., medical ethics, intricate financial transactions, environmental science), the Bahtsul Masail committee may invite external subject-matter experts to provide factual clarification and context before the fiqh-based deliberation commences.4During the session, participants, who come prepared having researched the issues, engage in rigorous debate. They present arguments (hujjah) and counter-arguments, citing textual evidence (ta’bir) from the kitab kuning, Qur'anic verses, and Hadith to support their respective positions.15 The discussion is guided by musahhih (rectifiers, verifiers, or directors), who are typically senior and highly respected kyais known for their mastery of Islamic jurisprudence. The musahhih play a crucial role in clarifying interpretations, ensuring the debate remains focused, assessing the validity of arguments, and ultimately guiding the forum towards a consensus or confirming the final ruling.15

The hierarchical and evolving methodology of Bahtsul Masail—progressing from qauly to ilhaqy and, when necessary, to manhajy—demonstrates a sophisticated and internally coherent legal system. This system is designed to balance an unwavering fidelity to the rich tradition of classical Islamic scholarship with the pressing imperative for contemporary relevance. It is far from a monolithic or rigid application of ancient texts; rather, it is a structured, dynamic process of interpretation and, when circumstances demand, principled legal development. The primary reliance on the qauly method 4 establishes and maintains a strong, unbroken connection to precedent and the accumulated wisdom of classical jurists. The inclusion of the ilhaqy method 4 allows for the logical extension of established rulings to new but analogous situations, a standard and indispensable tool in any developed legal system. The formal adoption and increasing utilization of the manhajy approach 4, especially for truly novel and complex contemporary issues, is the most significant indicator of Bahtsul Masail's dynamism. This method permits the formulation of new rulings based on underlying legal principles and objectives (maqasid al-shari'ah) rather than direct textual precedent, effectively constituting a form of guided, collective ijtihad within the established madhhab framework. This structured progression reveals an internal logic designed to equip traditional Islam with the intellectual tools to address an ever-expanding range of societal complexities.Furthermore, the pragmatic involvement of external subject-matter experts 4 prior to the commencement of the fiqh-based deliberation signifies a crucial recognition by NU scholars: an accurate understanding of the factual matrix of a contemporary problem (tasawwur al-mas'alah) is an indispensable prerequisite for sound and relevant Islamic legal judgment. Classical fiqh texts, while rich in legal principles, were composed in specific historical contexts and could not have anticipated the intricacies of many modern phenomena. By first seeking clarification from experts in fields such as medicine, economics, or technology ("LBM selalu meminta penjelasan terlebih dahulu kepada ahlinya" 4), Bahtsul Masail participants ensure they are addressing the actual, contemporary problem with precision before applying Islamic legal principles. This practice demonstrates an intellectual humility and a profound commitment to issuing well-informed and contextually appropriate rulings, rather than applying religious texts in an empirical or societal vacuum. This bridging of classical legal frameworks with modern specialized knowledge is a hallmark of Bahtsul Masail's adaptive capacity.Table 2: Comparative Overview of Bahtsul Masail MethodologiesMethodologyDefinition/PrinciplePrimary BasisWhen AppliedNature of RulingQauly (Textual)Direct textual reference to explicit opinions (qaul or wajh) in authoritative classical texts (kitab kuning).Explicit statements and interpretations found in kitab kuning, primarily of the Shafi'i school.When a clear, direct textual answer to the posed question is available in the recognized classical sources.Confirmatory, Re-affirmative of established views.Ilhaqy (Analogical)Analogical reasoning (qiyas); Equating a new case with a similar existing case that has an established ruling.Similarities (shared legal cause - 'illah) between the new, unresolved case and a precedented case in classical texts.When no direct text is found for the new issue, but a comparable precedent exists in the classical literature.Extrapolative, Extends existing rulings.Manhajy (Methodological)Application of the legal principles, methodologies (qawa'id al-ushuliyyah/fiqhiyyah), and spirit of the madhhab imams to derive rulings for novel issues.Broader principles of jurisprudence, legal maxims, and objectives of Shari'ah (maqasid al-shari'ah) as understood within the madhhab tradition.When no direct text or clear analogy is applicable, typically for entirely new or highly complex contemporary issues.Developmental, Ijtihadi (collective reasoning).4C. Formalization within NU: The Establishment and Role of Lajnah Bahtsul Masail (LBM-NU)While Bahtsul Masail-like deliberative activities had been a feature of Nahdlatul Ulama since its inaugural congress in 1926 15, the tradition initially operated without a highly formalized or permanent institutional structure within the organization.15 It was largely an ad hoc practice, convened as needed.The official institutionalization of Bahtsul Masail gained momentum in the late 1980s. A significant step was taken at the 28th NU National Congress (Muktamar) in Yogyakarta in 1989, where Commission I, which oversaw Bahtsul Masail matters, recommended to the Pengurus Besar Nahdlatul Ulama (PBNU – Central Executive Board of NU) the establishment of a permanent institution, the "Lajnah Bahtsul Masail Diniyah" (Committee for the Discussion of Religious Problems). The rationale was to create a dedicated body to systematically handle religious issues, particularly those that were "mauquf" (pending or unresolved) and "waqi'iyyah" (actual, contemporary, and pressing), and to provide authoritative legal certainty in a more structured manner.15 This recommendation was further reinforced by a halaqah (scholarly gathering) at Pesantren Mamba’ul Ma’arif in Denanyar, Jombang, in January 1990, which also endorsed the formation of Lajnah Bahtsul Masail Diniyah as a forum for NU scholars and intellectuals to engage in ijtihad jama’iy (collective ijtihad).15Consequently, the Lajnah Bahtsul Masail al-Diniyah (LBM-NU) was formally established in 1990 through a PBNU Decree (Surat Keputusan Nomor 30/A.I.05/5/1990).19 The system for its legal decision-making processes was further formalized in 1992 at the NU National Conference in Bandar Lampung.19Structurally, LBM-NU functions as a crucial division operating under the aegis of the NU Supreme Council (Majelis Syuriah).4 The Syuriah, composed primarily of senior and highly respected ulama, holds the highest authority within NU, serving as the ultimate controller, supervisor, and policymaker, and is responsible for issuing binding fatwas based on LBM deliberations.6 The LBM PBNU serves as the central national body, with its leadership periodically appointed (e.g., the 2022-2027 board).23The Bahtsul Masail mechanism is designed to operate at various hierarchical levels within NU's extensive organizational structure: from the Central Board (Pusat/PBNU), to Regional Boards (Wilayah/Provincial level), Branch Boards (Cabang/District or City level), and ideally extending down to Sub-Branch Representative Councils (Majelis Wakil Cabang/MWC at sub-district level) and even Ranting (twig/village or local unit level).4 The intended process for problem-solving is that issues should ideally be addressed first at the lowest possible level. If a resolution cannot be reached, the matter is then escalated to the next higher level for deliberation.4To manage the diverse range of issues it addresses, LBM discussions, particularly at the national level, are often organized into specialized commissions:
Komisi Waqi'iyyah (Actual/Casuistic Issues): Deals with concrete, practical problems and contemporary events requiring immediate legal responses.19
Komisi Maudhu'iyyah (Thematic Issues): Focuses on broader, thematic, and often theoretical religious, social, or conceptual topics that require in-depth study and deliberation.4 This commission, which reportedly gained prominence from the 1994 Muktamar, is often seen as a space for more academic and sometimes progressive or liberal theological exploration, often involving intellectuals with university backgrounds alongside traditional kyais.
Komisi Qanuniyyah (Legislative Issues): Addresses matters related to state law and legislation, examining their compatibility with Islamic principles or proposing Islamic perspectives on draft laws.19 This commission reportedly emerged around 2006.
The formal institutionalization of Bahtsul Masail as LBM-NU in the late 1980s and early 1990s can be interpreted as a strategic adaptation by Nahdlatul Ulama to the increasing complexities of modern Indonesian society. As Indonesia underwent significant socio-political transformations, particularly in the period leading up to and following the end of Suharto's New Order, there was a growing need for more systematic, authoritative, and nationally coordinated religious guidance. The recommendation at the 1989 Congress to form a "permanent office" to handle issues requiring "immediate legal certainty" 19 clearly suggests a perceived necessity for greater efficiency and authority in addressing a burgeoning array of contemporary problems. This formalization allowed for a more structured and specialized approach, exemplified by the later categorization of discussions into waqi'iyyah, maudhu'iyyah, and qanuniyyah commissions 19, thereby enhancing LBM's capacity to deal with diverse and intricate issues in a rapidly evolving national landscape.Furthermore, the multi-level structure of LBM, designed to operate from the central PBNU down to local branches 4, and the ideal process of escalating unresolved issues upwards, reflect NU's fundamental character as a mass-based organization with deep roots in communities across the archipelago. This hierarchical yet ideally accessible structure aims to provide relevant religious guidance at the grassroots level, addressing local concerns where they arise, while simultaneously ensuring that issues of national significance or profound complexity receive thorough and specialized deliberation at the higher echelons of NU's scholarly leadership. This organizational design mirrors NU's overall commitment to serving its broad and diverse membership base, attempting to connect the scholarly elite with the everyday religious needs of ordinary Muslims.D. Landmark Deliberations: Bahtsul Masail's Engagement with Contemporary Indonesian ChallengesThe Lajnah Bahtsul Masail of Nahdlatul Ulama has grappled with an extensive array of issues throughout its history, reflecting the evolving concerns of Indonesian society and the Muslim ummah. Its deliberations span matters of worship (ibadah), financial transactions (mu'amalat), criminal law (jinayat), inheritance law (mawarits), health, socio-cultural practices, and broader thematic (maudhu'iyyah), casuistic (waqi'iyyah), and legislative (qanuniyyah) questions.19 Between its inception in 1926 and 2009, Bahtsul Masail forums within NU had reportedly addressed over 500 distinct problems 15, underscoring the institution's dynamism and responsiveness.Several landmark deliberations highlight Bahtsul Masail's impact:

Family Planning (Keluarga Berencana - KB): The evolution of NU's stance on family planning is a prime example of how Bahtsul Masail has adapted its rulings over time in response to changing societal needs and understandings.

In 1938, an early ruling declared family planning programs illegal and haram (forbidden).19
By 1960, the position had nuanced. Delaying pregnancy was deemed legally permissible, but deliberately deciding not to have children was considered illegitimate. The use of contraceptives like condoms was generally categorized as makruh (discouraged), though it could become haram if it completely prevented pregnancy, unless there were compelling reasons, such as imminent danger or harm to a woman from too many childbirths.19
A significant shift occurred at the 28th Muktamar in 1989. It was decided that the use of intrauterine devices (IUDs), along with 'azl (coitus interruptus) or other contraceptives, was permissible. This pivotal change was notably influenced by the reasoning of K.H. Sahal Mahfudz, who emphasized the importance of considering the maqasid al-shari'ah (higher objectives of Islamic law). He argued that family planning should be viewed as a wasilah (means) to achieve good ends, such as family welfare and societal well-being. The legal justification for this change was attributed to a new 'illat (underlying legal cause or rationale) – namely, the pressing demands and conditions of the times.19



The Modern Nation-State and Citizenship: Perhaps one of the most globally significant recent rulings emerged from the NU National Conference of Religious Scholars (Munas Alim Ulama) in 2019.

The Bahtsul Masa'il ad-Diniyyah Maudluiyyah Commission issued a landmark decree stating that the legal category of kafir (infidel/non-believer) is not applicable to non-Muslim citizens within the context of a modern nation-state. Instead, non-Muslims are to be regarded as "fellow citizens" (muwathin) with equal rights and responsibilities.14
The ruling explicitly affirmed the theological legitimacy of the modern nation-state as a valid form of governance from an Islamic perspective.14
It further stipulated that Muslims have a religious obligation to obey the laws of the modern nation-state in which they reside.14
This decision was the product of collective ijtihad and was framed as a necessary "recontextualization" of classical Islamic teachings to align them with contemporary realities, democratic principles, and human rights.14



Response to Radicalism and Extremism: NU has consistently positioned itself against religious radicalism and extremism, a stance deeply rooted in its own historical emergence as a response to puritanical movements.24

Bahtsul Masail deliberations have reinforced this position. For instance, at its 31st Muktamar in 2004, NU officially condemned all forms of fundamentalism and extremism, viewing them as threats to the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia (NKRI) and to its own Ahl al-Sunnah wa al-Jama'ah (Aswaja) traditions, such as tahlilan (communal prayers for the deceased) and mauludan (commemoration of the Prophet Muhammad's birthday).24
NU, often informed by Bahtsul Masail discussions, supported state actions leading to the dissolution of radical groups like Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI) and the Islamic Defenders Front (Front Pembela Islam - FPI). The rationale provided was that the ideologies and actions of these groups were inconsistent with Aswaja values, the principles of Pancasila (Indonesia's state ideology), and threatened national unity.24



Pancasila as Sole Basis: A crucial Bahtsul Masail-informed decision was NU's formal acceptance of Pancasila as its 'sole basis' (asas tunggal) at its National Congress in Situbondo in 1984.2 This was a highly significant move that helped to integrate NU within the New Order state framework while allowing it to maintain its religious identity.

The evolution of the family planning fatwa 19 serves as a compelling illustration of Bahtsul Masail's capacity for what can be termed "renewal from within" (tajdid min ad-dakhil). This process demonstrates how NU scholars can meticulously reinterpret classical texts and apply broader Islamic legal principles, such as maqasid al-shari'ah and a nuanced consideration of the operative legal cause ('illat), to adapt religious rulings to changing societal needs, scientific advancements, and evolving ethical understandings. This adaptation occurs without abandoning the foundational traditional framework; rather, it enriches it. The initial 1938 ruling was strictly textual, based on specific interpretations of classical sources. The 1960 ruling introduced important nuances and recognized exceptions. The 1989 ruling, significantly shaped by maqasid-oriented thinking, represented a profound shift towards permissibility, grounded in the pursuit of societal benefit and the understanding of family planning as a legitimate means (wasilah) to achieve desirable ends. This clear progression demonstrates a dynamic legal hermeneutic at play, where the "demands of the times" and a deeper understanding of the objectives of Shari'ah can lead to a re-evaluation of previous positions and the formulation of new legal conclusions.Similarly, the 2019 ruling on the term "kafir" and the legitimacy of the nation-state 14 is a profound testament to Bahtsul Masail being utilized not merely for reactive, practical problem-solving but for proactive theological and political recontextualization with far-reaching national and even global implications. This ruling represents a concerted effort by NU to align core aspects of Islamic orthodoxy with modern democratic values, human rights, and the realities of pluralistic societies, thereby directly countering extremist narratives that exploit such terms for divisive purposes. By effectively abolishing the legal applicability of "kafir" to fellow citizens in a nation-state, NU's Bahtsul Masail dismantled a key theological justification often used by extremist groups to foster exclusion, enmity, and violence. Concurrently, affirming the legitimacy of the nation-state and the religious duty of Muslims to obey its laws directly challenges transnational caliphate ideologies promoted by groups like HTI. The description of this ruling as a product of "collective ijtihad" and "recontextualization" 14 underscores a conscious and deliberate strategy to reformulate potentially problematic aspects of classical jurisprudence to ensure their relevance and constructive application in the contemporary world, positioning NU as a significant voice in this global endeavor.Table 3: Selected Landmark Bahtsul Masail Rulings and Their Societal ImpactRuling/IssueYear(s)Key Points of the RulingSocietal/Political ImpactResolusi Jihad (Jihad Resolution)1945Declared the fight against returning Dutch colonial forces a holy war (jihad) and an individual religious obligation (fard 'ain) for Muslims in the vicinity.Mobilized mass popular resistance critical for the Indonesian independence struggle; Solidified NU's nationalist credentials and its role as a defender of the nation.Family Planning (Progressive Rulings)1960, esp. 1989Shift from initial prohibition/discouragement to permissibility of contraception based on maqasid al-shari'ah (objectives of Islamic law) and societal well-being.Provided religious legitimacy for government family planning programs; Addressed demographic concerns and contributed to improved maternal and child health; Showcased NU's adaptive jurisprudence.Acceptance of Pancasila as Sole Basis (Asas Tunggal)1984Affirmed that Pancasila (Indonesia's state ideology) is compatible with Islamic teachings; NU formally withdrew from partisan politics to focus on socio-religious activities (Khittah 1926).Reduced political tensions between NU and the New Order state; Allowed NU to preserve its organizational integrity and refocus on grassroots development; Strengthened national consensus around Pancasila.Abolition of "Kafir" for Non-Muslim Citizens / Legitimacy of Nation-State2019Declared the term kafir (infidel) inapplicable to non-Muslim fellow citizens in a modern nation-state; Affirmed the theological legitimacy of the nation-state and the duty to obey its laws.Strengthened national unity and interfaith harmony; Provided a strong theological counter-narrative to extremist ideologies; Enhanced NU's international standing as a proponent of moderate, contextual Islam.Condemnation of Radical Groups (e.g., HTI, FPI)Various (e.g., 2004, 2013, 2017)Declared ideologies of groups like Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI) and Front Pembela Islam (FPI) as incompatible with Ahl al-Sunnah wa al-Jama'ah, Pancasila, and threatening to national unity; Supported state dissolution efforts.Provided religious justification for state actions against radical organizations; Shaped public discourse on extremism and the nature of Indonesian Islam; Reinforced NU's role as a guardian of moderation and NKRI.2IV. Symbiosis and Impact: Nahdlatul Ulama, Bahtsul Masail, and the Shaping of Indonesian Islamic DiscourseA. The Intertwined Destinies of NU and its Deliberative ForumThe destinies of Nahdlatul Ulama as an organization and Bahtsul Masail as its primary intellectual and jurisprudential forum are inextricably intertwined. This symbiotic relationship has been a defining feature of NU's resilience and adaptability for nearly a century. NU, with its vast organizational infrastructure, enormous membership base, and considerable institutional authority, provides the platform and societal reach that accord Bahtsul Masail's rulings significant weight and influence across Indonesia.1 Without this organizational backing, the deliberations of Bahtsul Masail, however scholarly, might remain confined to academic circles.Conversely, the rigorous scholarly process, the adherence to classical methodologies, and the intellectual outputs of Bahtsul Masail are what furnish NU with its profound jurisprudential legitimacy and intellectual credibility. These deliberations are the bedrock upon which NU formulates its religious pronouncements, social stances, and responses to contemporary challenges.19 Bahtsul Masail is, therefore, central to NU's identity as a steadfast guardian of Ahl al-Sunnah wa al-Jama'ah and the rich scholarly heritage of the pesantren world. Its methodologies, particularly the emphasis on al-kutub al-mu'tabarah, ensure a vital continuity with classical Islamic scholarship, anchoring NU firmly within the traditionalist stream of Islam.4Simultaneously, and perhaps paradoxically to some, Bahtsul Masail serves as the primary engine of adaptation and renewal within NU. It is through this deliberative forum, especially with the incorporation and increasing use of the manhajy (methodological) approach and its direct engagement with complex contemporary issues, that NU adapts its traditional framework to the evolving realities of the modern world.4 This capacity to be both deeply traditional and remarkably adaptive is a key to understanding NU's enduring strength.The Bahtsul Masail process, with its characteristic emphasis on classical texts and robust scholarly debate, also functions as a crucial internal mechanism for maintaining a degree of cohesion within NU's vast and diverse scholarly community. Nahdlatul Ulama is not a monolithic entity; it encompasses a wide spectrum of views among its ulama and within its numerous affiliated pesantren.2 In such a large organization, the potential for divergent opinions is considerable. Bahtsul Masail provides a structured and recognized forum where these diverse scholarly perspectives can be articulated, debated, and, ideally, reconciled or synthesized into collective decisions (istinbath jama'i).19 The shared reliance on an agreed-upon corpus of authoritative sources (kitab kuning) and established methodologies (qauly, ilhaqy, manhajy) 4 creates a common epistemological ground and a shared language for discussion, even when interpretations differ. Therefore, Bahtsul Masail plays a vital role in channeling diverse scholarly opinions towards unified (though not always unanimously or universally agreed upon at all levels) organizational stances, thereby contributing to the overall coherence and authority of NU as a religious institution.B. The Influence of Bahtsul Masail Rulings on NU's Stance, Public Policy, and Social DynamicsThe rulings and deliberations emanating from Lajnah Bahtsul Masail-NU (LBM-NU) have a profound and multifaceted influence, shaping not only the official positions of Nahdlatul Ulama itself but also impacting broader public discourse, government policy, and social dynamics within Indonesia.The decisions produced by LBM-NU directly inform and often constitute NU's official stance on a wide spectrum of religious, social, and political issues.18 These rulings, once formulated and ratified by the Syuriah, are intended to be disseminated to NU's vast membership, guiding their understanding and practice of Islam.15 While, as discussed later, challenges exist in the effective socialization of these rulings to the grassroots, they nonetheless represent the authoritative voice of the organization.Given NU's sheer size, its deep societal penetration, and its historical influence, its fatwas and positions significantly shape public discourse on Islam in Indonesia.26 Media often report on major Bahtsul Masail decisions, and these rulings contribute to national conversations on critical issues. Furthermore, NU's stances can exert considerable influence on government policy or provide crucial religious legitimization for state actions. For example, the evolving fatwas on family planning played a role in the acceptance and implementation of national family planning programs.19 Similarly, NU's condemnations of extremist groups and its support for state measures against them have provided a religious underpinning for counter-radicalism efforts.18 The landmark 2019 "kafir" ruling is a clear instance of NU aiming to influence not just domestic perceptions but also to contribute to a global recontextualization of Islamic teachings, hoping its impact will reverberate throughout the Muslim world.14The impact of Bahtsul Masail on social dynamics is also significant. Rulings that promote inclusivity and re-evaluate potentially divisive classical interpretations, such as the 2019 decision on the term "kafir" for non-Muslim citizens, can directly contribute to fostering tolerance, mutual respect, and social harmony in Indonesia's pluralistic society.14 NU's consistent stance against radicalism and extremism, articulated through Bahtsul Masail and other platforms, plays a vital role in efforts to maintain national security and preserve the integrity of Indonesia's diverse social fabric.24 However, the overall societal impact is not uniform. The effectiveness of the dissemination of Bahtsul Masail rulings can significantly affect understanding and adherence at the grassroots level.15 Moreover, while some fatwas champion progressive and reformist ideas, others might reinforce conservative interpretations of traditionalism 26, reflecting the internal diversity within NU itself.The Bahtsul Masail mechanism allows Nahdlatul Ulama to perform a delicate and crucial balancing act: it enables the organization to consistently uphold its traditionalist credentials, which are vital for maintaining the allegiance of its core constituency, while simultaneously engaging with, shaping, and legitimizing aspects of modern Indonesian nationhood. The meticulous use of classical texts and established traditional methodologies in Bahtsul Masail 4 reassures the traditional base of NU’s unwavering commitment to its religious heritage. Concurrently, rulings that affirm the legitimacy of the nation-state, the principles of Pancasila, and the equal status of all citizens regardless of faith 13 demonstrate NU’s profound engagement with modern political realities and its commitment to national cohesion. This dual capacity allows NU to function effectively both as a deeply respected religious authority for its millions of followers and as a significant and influential socio-political actor within the national arena, a role that is key to its enduring influence and relevance.Furthermore, the "recontextualization" efforts prominently featured in recent Bahtsul Masail rulings, most notably the 2019 decision regarding the term "kafir" and the theological validation of the modern nation-state 14, signify NU's growing ambition to offer what might be termed an "Indonesian solution" to pressing global challenges within the Muslim world. This positions Islam Nusantara, not merely as a localized variant of Islam, but as a potential model for a globally relevant, moderate, peace-oriented, and contextually sensitive understanding of the faith. The explicit aim of the 2019 ruling to "Transform the Prevailing 'Muslim Mindset,' for the Sake of World Peace" 14, coupled with NU's launch of global initiatives to promote its vision 2, indicates a conscious strategy. NU is endeavoring to bring Islamic teachings "into alignment with the modern world of democracy and human rights" 14, effectively seeking to export the Indonesian traditionalist model of Islam, with its emphasis on deliberation, contextual interpretation, and societal harmony, as a constructive counter-narrative to extremist and exclusivist ideologies that have gained traction in various parts of the globe.V. Conclusion: Legacy, Contemporary Relevance, and Future HorizonsA. Recapitulation of Historical SignificanceNahdlatul Ulama's journey from its establishment in 1926 as a defensive bulwark for traditionalist Islam against the tides of modernism and colonial pressures, to its current status as the world's largest independent Islamic organization and a pivotal force in Indonesian religious, social, and political life, is a testament to its resilience and adaptability. Throughout this nearly century-long history, the Bahtsul Masail tradition has served as NU's intellectual and jurisprudential core. It has been the primary mechanism through which NU has interpreted Islamic teachings, preserved its scholarly heritage, and dynamically responded to the shifting challenges and opportunities of changing times, from the fight for independence to the complexities of nation-building and globalization.B. Contemporary Relevance and ContributionsIn the contemporary era, Nahdlatul Ulama's relevance remains undiminished. Its most prominent contribution is arguably the promotion of Islam Nusantara – a vision of Islam that is moderate, tolerant, culturally adaptive, and deeply rooted in Indonesian traditions.1 This vision serves as a crucial bulwark against the spread of religious extremism and radicalism, not only within Indonesia but also offering a potential model for other Muslim societies. NU makes profound contributions to national unity and interfaith dialogue, leveraging its moral authority and vast grassroots network. Its extensive web of educational institutions, from thousands of pesantren to a growing number of universities, and its diverse social service programs, play a vital role in human resource development and community welfare. The Bahtsul Masail tradition continues to be of paramount importance, providing indispensable religious guidance on new and complex ethical, social, and technological issues confronting Indonesian Muslims in the 21st century.C. Challenges and Future ProspectsDespite its strengths and contributions, Nahdlatul Ulama faces several challenges that will shape its future trajectory:
Effective Dissemination of Rulings: A persistent challenge is the effective socialization and dissemination of Bahtsul Masail decisions to its vast and diverse grassroots membership. Organizational limitations, sociological factors such as varying literacy levels and preferences for oral culture among some segments, and the strong psychological influence of local kyais (who may not always align with central PBNU rulings) hinder the uniform understanding and application of LBM decisions.15 Bridging the gap between the sophisticated legal reasoning of LBM scholars and the everyday religious understanding of its broad membership, particularly in an era of rapid online information and competing religious narratives, is a critical task.
Managing Internal Diversity: NU is a "big tent" organization encompassing a wide spectrum of views, from staunchly conservative factions to more progressive elements.2 Ensuring that the Bahtsul Masail process remains a unifying force, capable of accommodating this internal diversity while producing coherent and authoritative guidance, is an ongoing challenge.
Navigating Modernity and Global Influences: The organization must continue to adapt to rapid technological advancements, evolving social norms, and complex global influences while steadfastly maintaining its core identity and foundational principles. The observation regarding a "negative impact" stemming from a "lack of adaptation to other religious groups" 10 requires careful internal reflection and reconciliation with NU's broader message of tolerance and its concept of ukhuwah wathaniyah (national brotherhood) and ukhuwah basyariyah (humanitarian brotherhood).
Leadership Regeneration and Scholarly Development: The long-term vitality of NU and the Bahtsul Masail tradition depends critically on effective leadership succession and the continuous development of a new generation of ulama. These future scholars must be proficient not only in classical Islamic scholarship but also possess a deep understanding of contemporary issues and modern disciplines to sustain the intellectual rigor and relevance of Bahtsul Masail.
D. Concluding ReflectionNahdlatul Ulama and its distinctive Bahtsul Masail tradition represent a unique and remarkably resilient model of Islamic traditionalism. Over nearly a century, they have demonstrated an extraordinary capacity for adaptation and constructive engagement with the forces of modernity. Their legacy is not one of static preservation of the past, but of dynamic interpretation, recontextualization, and application of Islamic principles within a specific, evolving national and global context. The future of NU and Bahtsul Masail will depend on their continued ability to navigate these intellectual and social engagements effectively. Addressing internal challenges related to dissemination and diversity, while responding adeptly to external pressures and opportunities, will be crucial for them to remain a guiding force for Indonesian Muslims and a compelling voice for moderate, compassionate, and contextually relevant Islam in the wider world.The success of NU's model of "dynamic traditionalism," as exemplified by Bahtsul Masail, is deeply intertwined with Indonesia's specific socio-cultural and political milieu, including the centuries-old pesantren culture, a national history marked by religious pluralism (despite challenges), and the existence of a democratic space that allows for such deliberations. While the underlying principles of contextual interpretation, emphasis on maqasid al-shari'ah, and collective scholarly reasoning offer valuable lessons, the direct "exportability" of the NU model to other Muslim societies with different historical trajectories and socio-political conditions remains a complex question, requiring careful consideration of local contexts. Nevertheless, NU's journey offers a powerful example of how traditional Islamic thought can not only survive but thrive and contribute meaningfully in the modern age.
